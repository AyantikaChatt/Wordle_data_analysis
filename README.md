# Wordle_data_analysis
I love word games like Wordle and Connections, so I have written the script below to study the world of word-guessing patterns more profoundly. In this research, we concentrate on those letters that are mostly guessed correctly as a first attempt in a game of Wordle. Here is what the script does:

Data Preparation: To work only with complete game data sets, it filters out rows where answer is missing.
Letter Extraction: For each game, the first guess is examined by the script to determine positions of correct letters represented by green square (ðŸŸ©).
Letter Collection: These letters are then picked from the actual answer to form an inclusive list.
Frequency Analysis: The pandas series counts how many times each letter appears as right guesses in the dataframe.
Visualization: A horizontal bar chart, visually representing frequency of accurate guesses for each letter generated by the script makes these results easy to grasp and captivating.

In addition to quenching my inquisitiveness, this analysis provides insights into guessing patterns that could make me better at playing future word games; a combination between my love for data analysis and word games while having fun respectively!
